A mobile-friendly ePub reader for browsers and mobile devices (via Ionic/Angular).

Implemented as an Angular directive, compatible with Ionic / Angular v1, intended for inclusion into other Ionic apps and for use on mobile devices. A sample Ionic app shows how to integrate to a larger Ionic app. Work is currently under way to integrate this reader into [Bookship](https://www.bookshipapp.com), a Social Reading app. 

ionic-epub-reader is a reworking of [Patrick G](https://github.com/geek1011)'s excellent [ePubViewer](https://github.com/geek1011/ePubViewer), to make it compatible with [AngularJS] v1 and [Ionic v1](https://ionicframework.com/docs/v1/), to make it mobile-friendly, and to introduce additional capabilities. The feature set is intended to be comparable to those of major readers such as the Kindle and Kobo apps.

Key features introduced by Ionic-epub-reader include:

* Bookmarking - pages can be bookmarked. 
* Highlighting - passages can be selected and marked for permanent highlighting
* Annotation - highlights can optionally have user-generated notes attached to them.
* Integration with external search engines - searches of Google & Wikipedia can be invoked directly from highlighted text, with results shown in a new browser window.
* Paging via swiping

An additional tab has been added which lists all Bookmarks, Highlights and Notes, and allows navigation within the book to each item.

Ionic-epub-reader is intended for integration with other apps. All major reader lifecycle events generate Angular events with the data necessary for external apps to handle storage / reload of the relevant data. The sample app shows handling of those lifecycle events. The primary component is a custom AngularJS Directive encapsulating the viewer. You can easily add this as a module to your own app. 

Optionally, Ionic-epub-reader will also store all user data in localStorage. It is expected this is primarily of use for standalone usage, or for testing. 

This repo includes a sample ionic App app illustrating use.

## Installation

Start a new Ionic v1 project as follows:

Ensure you have Ionic V1 installed.

```
ionic start ionic-epub-reader blank --type ionic1
```

This directive makes use of two Ionic/Cordova plugins, the [inAppBrowser](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-inappbrowser) and StatusBar, you will need to install them as well:

```
cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-inappbrowser
cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-statusbar
```

#### Using script tag

Modify your index.html file to include the following:

```html
<link href="lib/normalize.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
<link href="css/readerstyle.css" rel="stylesheet">
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Merriweather" rel="stylesheet">
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lato:400,400i,700,700i" rel="stylesheet">
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Spectral" rel="stylesheet">
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Libre+Baskerville" rel="stylesheet">
<script src="lib/sanitize-html.min.js"></script>
<script src="lib/jszip.min.js"></script>
<script src="lib/epub.v0.3.66.js"></script>
<script src="js/angularEpubReader.js"></script>
```

You will also need to copy the files in the `images` directory to an `images` directory in your project, and the files in the `templates` directory to a `templates` directory in your
project.

(Yes, this should really be packaged with NPM or something, to avoid all this hackery, but I don't know how :) (yet). 


Be sure to include `<allow-navigation href="*" />` in your config.xml, or the whitelist plugin may block download of the ePub files.

(some people have reported they also needed to include something to the effect of 
`<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy"
		content="default-src gap://ready file://* blob: *; style-src 'self' blob: http://* https://* 'unsafe-inline'; script-src 'self' http://* https://* 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'">`) in their index.html.

NOTE: This directive uses a slightly modified version of epub.js, see below.

Include the custom directive in your index.html file, or in a template (see for example the file ```tab-reader.html``` in the example app).

```html
<ion-pane>
    <ion-content overflow-scroll="true">
    	<epubreader></epubreader>
    </ion-content>
 </ion-pane>
```

The directive accepts arguments per the below:

The `<epubreader>` directive accepts arguments:

* `src-doc`: a url pointing to an ePub file to load. If not present, the user is presented with an open file button.
* `use-local-storage`: true|false, controls whether user data (e.g. bookmarks) are persisted to the browser's localStorage
* `highlight-array`: optional. An array of highlights to be loaded to the book after load is complete. highlights should consist of a cfi field, and optionally an annotationText field for annotations. see `controllers.js` for an example.  
*  `bookmark-array`: optional. An array of bookmarks to be loaded to the book after load is complete. see `controllers.js` for an example. 
*  `start-location`: optional. A CFI that indicates where the book should be positioned after loaded. Useful if you want to (for example) launch the reader to a particular bookmark or annotation

#### Add module "epubreader" as dependency

```
angular.module('starter', ['ionic', 'epubreader'])
```

The directive relies on a small number of images (primarily custom icons), which must be located in "../img/".

In order for the in-app browser and associated Google and Wikipedia features to work, you must:

```
ionic cordova add platform browser
```

then 'ionic serve' will allow the in-app browser window to work.

### Loading an ePub file

Once the app is running you should see a button entitled 'Open reader'. Hit that button and load an epub file, e.g. [Treasure Island](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/120) - the file called
"_EPUB (with images)_" works nicely. Ionic-epub-reader has been tested with works from [Project Gutenburg](http://www.gutenberg.org/) as well as
[Standard Ebooks](https://standardebooks.org/). The button 'Treasure Island' loads a prestored version of Treasure Island; 'Treasure Island w/annotations' loads the book with some
pre-defined annotations.


### Lifecycle events

A variety of events are generated at key lifecycle events, to support integration with external applications, for example for external storage of annotations. Events will often return objects describing
a bookmark or a highlight (optionally including an annotation / note). These structures are:

bookmark:

```
{
	type: 'bookmark',
	cfi: <canonical fragment identifier for the location>,
	text: <text from roughly the location of the bookmark>,
	chapterLabel: <text for chapter / division heading >,
	dogeartext: <a textual description of the location of this mark, including % of the way through the book>,
	positionPercentage: <float, % of way through book>
}
```

highlight:

```
{
	type: 'highlight',
	cfi: <canonical fragment identifier for the location>,
	text: <the highlighted text>,
	(optional) annotationText: <text of note added by user>,
	dogeartext: <a textual description of the location of this mark, including % of the way through the book>,
	positionPercentage: <float, % of way through book>
	range: <browser Range object>
}
```

Note the internal structures carried by the directive code differ slightly from these event objects.

The key lifecycle events and their arguments:

* ```epubReaderBookmarkSave```: issued after a bookmark is saved; carries bookmark as argument
* ```epubReaderBookmarkDelete```: issued after a bookmark is deleted; carries bookmark as argument
* ```epubReaderHighlightSave```: issued whenever a highlight is saved by the user; carries highlight structure as argument. 
* ```epubReaderHighlightDelete```: issued after a highlight is deleted. The semantics of the reader are that if a highlight is deleted, any attached annotations are automatically deleted as well.
* ```epubReaderAnnotationSave```: issued whenever an annotation / note is saved by the user. Carries the highlight structure as argument, that the annotation is attached to, and the annotationText field will be present with the highlight.
* ```epubReaderAnnotationDelete```: issued after an annotation is deleted. This does not delete the associated highlight.
* ```epubReaderSaveSettings```: issued whenever reader settings are changed (currently, just display options); carries settings object as argument
* ```epubReaderCurrentLocation```: issued whenever reader location is changed; carries position as argument
* ```epubReaderNextPage```: issued whenever (next) paging occurs; carries the position BEFORE the page change as argument
* ```epubReaderPrevPage```: issued whenever (prev) paging occurs; carries the position BEFORE the page change as argument
* ```epubReaderSetLocation```: issued when the user manually sets a location (page) number. Carries the target position as an argument, in the form of a structure containing  {location: <int>, cfi: cfi, bookLength: <int>}
* ```epubReaderTextSelected```: issued whenever the user selects text, before a highlight is created; carries as argument a structure containing {text, cfi, range} fields.
* ```epubReaderExit```: issued when the user exits the reader.

The example app shows how to monitors these events, e.g.:

```
$rootScope.$on('epubReaderBookmarkSave', function (event, data) {
    	console.log('READER_EVENT: bookmark save', event, JSON.stringify(data.bookmark));
    });
```

### Prerequisites

You will need to have Ionic V1 installed to run the sample app.

### Changes from ePubViewer.

This reader contains a number of features the original reader by [Patrick G](https://github.com/geek1011) did not. 

Parts of it are substantially re-written, parts become simpler by using the Angular templating system, other parts (styling, for example) are mostly unchanged, except to rename
some classes to prevent collision with Ionic's built-in styling classes. I have also removed the original project's dependency on jQuery. I have also updated the font selection and made
minor changes to the styling, particularly to address mobile devices. 

A simpler, pure Angular/Ionic version of that reader, without the extra bells & whistles, can be found here: [angular-epub-reader](https://github.com/viking2917/angular-epub-reader). It is
more-or-less a straight AngularJS/Ionic port of [ePubViewer](https://github.com/geek1011/ePubViewer).

### Changes to epub.js.

This directive uses [ePub.js] in a slightly modified form, to enable selection and highlighting to work on mobile devices. In particular, the "onSelectionChange" handler in epub.js (~
line 4842) is changed to have a 2 second endTimeout instead of 250 milliseconds. This gives the user time to adjust the drag handles on mobile devices - otherwise the event fires so quickly
that selection is assumed to be done by the system before the user can intervene to change the range selected. Hacky, I know. Open to better suggestions.

## Tests

Tests are implemented via [Testcafe](https://www.testcafe.com), and are located in the `tests` directory. Installing testcafe is straightforward:

```
npm install -g testcafe
npm install testcafe-angular-selectors
```

I also had to do this (your mileage may vary):
```
npm link testcafe
```

to run the tests, go to the project directory and:

```
./tests/run.bash
```

## Gotchas & Oddities

I found that the Ionic keyboard (done with the native plugin) will cause screen resizes after the keyboard is displayed. This causes the epub to redisplay. When the screen is resized and
then redisplayed you may find yourself on a different page than when you started the keyboard. This was particularly evident on editing Notes, after editing you would be left on a different page, where the note
was not visible. Theoretically setting

```
<preference name="KeyboardResize" value="false" />
```

should do it, but it seems not to work on Android. I adopted [this workaround](https://github.com/ionic-team/cordova-plugin-ionic-keyboard/issues/8) from @olivermuc.

Ionic-epub-reader has been tested on iOS and Android devices, Chrome, and to a lessor extent Firefox. Browser bugs entirely possible. :)
